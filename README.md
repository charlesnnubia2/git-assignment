                                  # Version Control
Version control also known as source code management is a process for tracking and managing changes to source code and assets.

                                  # Git vs Github
Git is a free open source version control system that you install locally on your computer to manage code changes, while github is a cloud based hosting service where you can store and share your git repositories.

# Github alternatives:
1. GitLab
2. Bitbucket
3. Azure DevOps

                                  # Git fetch vs Git pull
   Git fetch retrieves updates from a remote repository, but doesn't apply them to your local working directory while Git pull etrieves updates from a remote repository and immediately merges them into your current branch.
